This C# code for Nanoframework ESP32 with the SPI-only Arducam Mega 3MP.
The driver is fully C#, translated and adapted from Micropython code https://github.com/CoreElectronics/CE-Arducam-MicroPython
A critical method was missing from the python code so I had to fish it out and translate it from the original Arducam C/C++ driver.
Technically, it uses one SPI for the SD reader and a second SPI for the cam which does not require I2C. One picture takes ~3 seconds.
I have been waiting for a long time to be able to take a picture with Nanoframework ðŸ˜€

Edit: works also with Arducam Mega 5MP.
